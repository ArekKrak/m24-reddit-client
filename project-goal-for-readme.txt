PROJECT GOAL

Build a responsive Reddit client using React and Redux that lets users browse popular posts, search Reddit, filter by subreddit, and view post details with comments (including Markdown rendering). The app will be tested, deployed, and optimised to score 90+ on Lighthouse (except media-related performance).
