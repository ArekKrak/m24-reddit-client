# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

### Performance & quality

- Automated tests:
  - Unit tests for core reducers and UI components (`postsSlice`, Header, Post cards/list, subreddit sidebar).
  - One end-to-end test (`App.e2e.test.js`) covering the main user journey: load → search → open a post → view comments.

- Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools, local build):
  - **Mobile:** Performance ~75, Accessibility 100, Best Practices 100, SEO 100.
  - **Desktop:** Performance 99, Accessibility 100, Best Practices 100, SEO 100.

These scores confirm that the app is fast, accessible, and follows modern web best practices on both mobile and desktop.

## IMPORTANT
This app uses Reddit’s undocumented JSON API. In some environments Reddit currently returns HTML instead of JSON, which surfaces as a parse error and triggers the app’s mock-data fallback. On environments where the JSON API responds correctly, the app displays live posts and comments.
